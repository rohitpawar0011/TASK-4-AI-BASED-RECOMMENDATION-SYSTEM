**DESCRIPTION** :
Creating an AI-based recommendation system using Java and libraries like Apache Mahout involves several key steps, including setting up the development environment, preparing sample data, implementing the recommendation engine, and generating recommendations. Here's a detailed description of the process:

**Overview**
A recommendation system suggests products or content to users based on their preferences and behavior. This project uses collaborative filtering, a popular technique in recommendation systems, to make personalized recommendations. Apache Mahout, a scalable machine learning library, is used to implement the recommendation engine.

**Set Up Your Development Environment**
Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the Oracle website.

Set Up Apache Mahout: Download Apache Mahout from the Apache Mahout website.

**Create a Maven Project**
Create a New Maven Project: Use your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) to create a new Maven project.

**Add Dependencies**: 
Add the necessary dependencies to your pom.xml file. For Apache Mahout, you can add the following dependency:

**Prepare Sample Data**
Prepare a sample dataset that contains user preferences. For example, you can create a CSV file with user IDs, item IDs, and ratings.

**Implement the Recommendation Engine**
Load the Data: Use Apache Mahout to load the sample data.

Create a Data Model: Create a data model to represent the user-item interactions.

Build the Recommender: Use a collaborative filtering algorithm to build the recommender.

Generate Recommendations: Generate recommendations for users based on their preferences.

**Explanation**
Load the Data: The FileDataModel class loads the sample data from a CSV file.

Create a User Similarity Measure: The PearsonCorrelationSimilarity class calculates the similarity between users based on their preferences.

Create a User Neighborhood: The NearestNUserNeighborhood class identifies the nearest neighbors for a user.

Build the Recommender: The GenericUserBasedRecommender class builds the recommendation engine using collaborative filtering.

Generate Recommendations: The recommend method generates recommendations for a specified user.

**Conclusion**
This Java program demonstrates how to build a recommendation system using Apache Mahout. The system loads user preferences from a CSV file, calculates user similarities, identifies user neighborhoods, and generates recommendations. You can extend this program by using more sophisticated algorithms, incorporating additional data, and improving the user interface.
